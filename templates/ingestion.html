      <p style="color:#73656F;font-size:20px;">Not any oil at any age. There are appropriate ways to use EOâ€™s in this manner, however without an appropriately licensed professional you could risk your own life or the life of someone else without knowing it.</p>

      <p style="color:#73656F;font-size:20px;">In the event that an adult or a child has ingested an EO in more than trace amounts, giving activated charcoal will minimize toxicity. Mark the dosage of charcoal for the hospital if a trip is made to the emergency room. Activated charcoal is what
        most hospitals will give in the event of consumption of a toxic substance.</p>
